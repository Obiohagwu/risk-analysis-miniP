# Problem Statement:
To classify borrowers as "likely to default" and "Unlikely to default" based on prior credit history. This means, given a set of predictor variables, we would need to produce target output as 1: Defaulter and 0: Non-defaulter.

# Data Engineering:
The data used in this mini-project has been procured from lending club website database, which stores tons of historiacal financial histroy data of multple individuals giving us a comprehensive enough scope of predictor variables.
